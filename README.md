💰 AI-Powered Personal Finance Assistant (Money Coach)

📌 Problem
Many individuals struggle with managing their monthly salary. While they receive a steady income, they often lack the skills or tools to allocate it properly across different needs. As a result, overspending on non-essential items is common, leaving little for savings or emergencies. Traditional budgeting methods require discipline and are difficult to maintain, while many existing apps are either too complicated or fail to provide personalized advice. The absence of a simple, adaptive, and user-friendly solution makes personal finance management overwhelming for most people.

✅ Solution
The proposed solution is an AI-powered personal finance assistant (Money Coach) that acts as a digital guide to help individuals budget, save, and track their money effectively. By allowing users to input their salary and expenses, the system creates an optimized budget and provides personalized financial insights. It simplifies expense tracking through clear visualizations and generates monthly reports to show savings progress. The assistant focuses on ease of use, personalization, and actionable advice rather than overwhelming users with complex financial jargon.
